My name is Samuel Hibbard. I love programming, play board games and DND games. Love video games, books, and music. Can play several instruments. I love my family and doing activties with them. Currently I am an iOS Software Developer for USAA.

I wanted to start my own personal wiki/blog website to put my ideas out there on the internet. I am hopeful this will start going somewhere. Not sure how to proceed but I figured I could start here. Please reach out to me on Twitter if you have any ideas for me. My Twitter account link is below.
