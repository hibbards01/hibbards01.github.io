I have been wanting to create a wiki/blog for my ideas of a story that has been brewing in my head for some time now. Maybe about 5-6 yrs. Can't remember when I started have this idea. Anyways I have been wanting to create a book, video game, art about this idea. But I never went to put these ideas down on paper. This is why I have created this wiki to hopefully start the process and maybe get my ideas flowing. If not this will be a good learning experience regardless. I feel I need to start somewhere. Alrighty here it goes:

## Setting
It all started with an idea where a man feels like he doesn't have any control with his destiny. That someone else is always pulling at his heart strings and that he can't do anything about it. He made an oath with the devil (or someone) that now controls his fate. He did this mainly to protect a person he loved from destruction which did not help in the end. Now he is bound to that person doing whatever he says.

The pictures you see to the side are some ideas of what I want the person to look like. Basically a black robed figure that lurks in the shadows. That is the domain that he lives in all the time. The oath that he made granted him immeasurable power. That person wants him to do things that will be to that persons beneficial.

Here some example images I am thinking that I grabbed from the internet:
